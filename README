This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-kcrash layer.
This layer effectively brings crash-python tool to openembedded enviornment.
Crash-python tool is modern replacement for crash tool that is to investigate linux kernel dump files.
Crash-python advantage over crash tool is that implemented as addition to modern gdb and can support various extensions
implemented in regular python code running inside of gdb.

Naturally it brings dependencies of crash-python tool:
  - gdb-python: set of additional patches that brings additional python captablities to standard gdb
  - libkdumpfile: Library that can read kernel dump file.

Currently supported archiceture is x86_64. Work on supporting other archicetures is in progress.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

I. Adding the meta-kcrash layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-kcrash'

II. Build
=========
To get crash-python installed as linux-yocto recipe-sysroot-native add the following line to conf/local.conf

DEPENDS_append_pn-linux-yocto = " crash-python-native gdb-cross-x86_64"

Make sure that you enable kernel debug symbols in the build by add the following line to conf/local.conf

KERNEL_EXTRA_FEATURES_append = " features/debug/debug-kernel.scc"


III. Invocation
===============
After build of linux-yocto find the crash-python in

$BUILDDIR/tmp-glibc/work/qemux86_64-oe-linux/linux-yocto/*/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin/pycrash

Invoke pycrash as

pycrash vmlinux vmcore

For example

$BUILDDIR/tmp-glibc/work/qemux86_64-oe-linux/linux-yocto/*/recipe-sysroot-native/usr/bin/pycrash \
   tmp-glibc/work/qemux86_64-oe-linux/linux-yocto/5.8.13+gitAUTOINC+34775c20bc_5981001bf0-r0/linux-*-build/vmlinux \
   ~/vmcore


IV. Kdump supported formats
===========================
If you want crash-python to understand lzo and/or snappy compressed dump files enable "lzo" and/or "snappy" package features for example
by adding the following line to conf/local.conf

PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-libkdumpfile-native = " lzo snappy"

V. Upstream Projects URIs
=========================
All great functionality of crash-python comes from the following upstream projects, meta-kcrash layer merely assembles them in open embedded format.

  crash-python:  https://github.com/crash-python/crash-python

  libkdumpfile:  https://github.com/ptesarik/libkdumpfile

  gdb-python:    https://github.com/crash-python/gdb-python
